## About
This interactive web map tracks tests for the corona virus disease (COVID-19) in New York City using publically available data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).

It includes layers from the United States Center for Disease Control's "Social Vulnerability Index."

This is still a work in progress. Indicators, layers, and methodology are open for scrutiny, and can change. Please submit any comment to ashaiban@pratt.edu, or fork the project at GitHub. This needs a lot more work, so any suggestions, contributions, or tips are welcome and invited.
